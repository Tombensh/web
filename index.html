        <h2>About us</h2>
    <div class="Descrition">
        <p>LowerTone is a home-made bass guitar-shop, established in early 2019 by Tom Ben Sheffer. </p>
      <p>  It all started 10 years ago, on 2009. Tom, was an electric-guitar player studied in Hof-Hasharon regional school. <br/>
        The end of the semester was near,
        and the staff searched for musicians among the students to assemble a band and play in the end of the semester ceremony. <br/>
        Tom noticed that there are many guitar players, but no bass players. So he went on and tried it once. And in the next semester again.. and again...<br/>
        Tom became a decent Bass player (the only bass player in school), and liked it! </p>
        <p>Ever since, Tom has the passion for bass guitars. He played in many many bands and music-groups, performed on many stages and recorded some music too.<br/>
        Ever since Tom volunteered for the army, he did not manage to keep on playing liked he used to do, but the passion for bass guitars kept occupying his dreams. </p>
        So! in order to keep on working on his desire, Tom opened the online bass-guitar shop - LowerTone.
